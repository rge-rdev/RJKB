In order to dissect Docusaurus and find out where all the bloat in main.js is coming from - you need to install BundleAnalyzerPlugin for Webpack.

However, I have found that for larger builds - 1000 /docs pages+ - the build will mysteriously crash (without a single meaningful helpful error log) when loading BundleAnalyzerPlugin.
