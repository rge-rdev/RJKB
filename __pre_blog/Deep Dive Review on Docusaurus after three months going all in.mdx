Docusaurus is very convenient for a small >1000 page documentation site.

## Docusaurus breaks down with large numbers of pages

Docusaurus really does not scale well with large number of pages. See more here.

Assuming your build doesn't crash prematurely, then prepare to face a huge

## MDX is premature and a pain in the ASCII

For SIMPLE, non-programmatically generated content - it's probably perfectly fine. But it will be horrendously optimized.

Using MDX on programmatically generated pages (with mixed JSX and code snippets) has been a royal pain. This problem is compounded by docusaurus freezing its dependencies at MDX v1, due to (some relatively minor) breaking changes in MDX v2.

All the mdx-loader boils down to is simply: Syntactic sugar over React.createElement calls. Pass one single illegal character into mdx and you can enjoy a tedious goose chase up the broken call stack.

The worst issues lie with `<CodeBlock>` mdx syntax - and it took a lot of brutal trial and error to find

Some major annoyances I've discovered along the way include:

- Table of Contents - generation ONLY works on MDX documents with PURE plain markdown headers

  - Apart from a few exceptions,

-

## It's the Docusaurus way, or the highway (to hell)

Docusaurus is not for ideal for someone who wants to deeply customize layouts and components - it's a massive hassle. Swizzling is really far more work and effort, than simply patching the modules directly from the source.

I'm never a fan of learning another CSS class-based library. But Infima sucks on several fronts.

I'm sure Facebook has a great (private) internal documentation for Infima
