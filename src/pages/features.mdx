# Features List of RJKB

## 🥇 SSG Over SSG

Custom RJ SSG Node.js Script to transform JSON DB (export from [Remnote](./blog/)) into full featured MDX, statically output to respective file routes based on doc hierachy

- ✅ RJ SSG Scripts transform JSON into MDX & TSX

- ✅ transform JSON DB into `Map<string, string[]>` to hash out each doc UID to children, keys, values, references, etc

- ✅ transform each key & value array

- ✅ dedup tags

- ✅ output fancy CLI logs (@deprecated due to lag! Turns out that spamming process.stdout.write() every few ms REALLY SLOWS down everything, despite how awesome it looked!☹)

- ✅ output optional debug YAML frontmatter with alias IDs, aliases, references, ID, filepath & route

- Low priority TODOS

  - 🚧 Dedup alias mdx & sibling/child mdx programmatically - ie ../Bittorent/Torrent.mdx && ../Bittorent/Torrent/torrent.mdx (which this was trimmed from .torrent). This build exit to avoid race condition - which only throws for prod Build BUT NOT client build. Since this was the only example, it was simpler to just delete the alias redirect.

  - 🚧 Migrate all redirects away from react-router `<Redirect />` and explore a less client heavy redirect solution via `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects` to config inside docusaurus.config.js. Just need to programmatically output redirects array to paste inside. Only worth exploring if the latter pushes a (impactfully) smaller js bundle to the client, which improves loading speed for <2G connections, otherwise, `<Redirect />` works just fine as is.

### Map JSON DB to doc hierachy

Hashing out all doc objects from the JSON input greatly improved efficiency, in terms of retrieval and memoization. See original client app demo (once fixed) for good example of how excessive recursion impacts perf

- ✅ hash out all docs from JSON & trim unused props

- ✅ map Doc UID to adjancency list of doc, children, parent, references

- ✅ map Doc UID to slugified key-name && skip codeblocks/non-compat keys

- ✅ map Doc UID to adjancency list of route path - via parent & slug maps

- ✅ utility fn to getDoc, getChildren, etc from (id: string)

- 🚧 refactor regex replace logic

- 🚧 trim 🤬

### Output static MDX & TSX files into designated dir hierachy

- ✅ static docs output 6666 MDX nested in 5,904 Folders

- ✅ static output 1300+ Preview FC .tsx & import to each mdx

- ✅ output @XX Alias/Synonym `<Redirect />`

- ✅ output optional debug files to inspect Tags, Keywords, Aliases

- ✅ switch to synchronous outputFile in recursive calls

- ❌ too many concurrent async fs.outputFile() calls resulted in corrupted string output 💣 - this took a while to debug - [read more here](./blog)

## 🥇 Hover Link Previews

- ✅ static preview page complete with

  - ✅ key with aka list of aliases and blockquote of definition

  - ✅ References list with citation count, 5 or less list & conditional view more button to redirect to ../link_key#references

    - ✅ highlight hover word in reference list

  - ✅ fix arrow, opacity, z-index

  - ✅ Responsive width layout AND text-size for screen/mobile variants

  - ✅ Dark/light variants

- ✅ Selectively render hover previews only for descriptions - and not headings - to avoid duplicating content that's already visible on the page

- ✅ patch-package `react-tooltip` to default to 150ms delay to show tooltip, to reduce accidental triggers when moving mouse across screen. Opt for patch at source, to prevent thousands of duplicate `data-tooltip-delay-show` props showing up in html

- 🚧 🐌Low priority: fix Hover Previews for mobile. Some touchscreen devices still trigger previews after pressing and holding down link - but not same instant seamless browsing experience vs mouse.

  - 💡 add mobile-only JS to trigger preview ontouchdown (after >500ms) - trigger navigate if link held for less.

  - 💡 add mobile-only JS to tap once for preview, tap twice for navigate? Will be annoying if user wanted to navigate initially, instead of looking for preview.

- ❌ render Preview FC directly into doc MDX - works but

- ❌ client-side render for Preview doesn't work due to id_to_mdx transform call chain requiring access to all data maps, which were inside scripts requiring node runtime specific libraries such as process. It seems Webpack 5+ cut out polyfill support for a good reason - and that hacks to polyfill this wouldn't be worth the extra hit to client network loading time & compute.

- ❌ for unclear reasons (possibly due to the above), renderToStaticMarkup() didn't work

## 🥇 Self-hosted Typesense Search

Self-hosted Typesense server as run on Docker instance on fly.io

⚡ fast typo-tolerant fuzzy search. Read more on [setting up self-hosted typesense search for docusaurus](./blog/)

### Typesense backend secured

- ✅ disabled CORS & whitelist ifullstack.dev & vercel sub-domain deployments via POST to typesense server /config

- ✅ POST documents collection to update crawler results & strip "#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback" from url field & hits. Now docsearch patch no longer needs regex to replace that anchor. Also, JSON search hits res is 10%+ smaller.

- ✅ scoped API key for frontend with access to only perform search actions for documents on main typesense collection

- ✅ migrate from bootstrap API key to Admin key for debug

- ✅ migrate all Typesense parameters expose in docusaurus.config.js to ENV for extra security

- ✅ update to typesense v0.25.0

- ✅ for now, there's no need to scope aditional keys

- 🚧 swizzle docsearch component to query separate backend for OTP with search-scoped API key instead of hard coding scoped key (and more importantly add some kind of auth to distinguish legitimate user agents from bots/scrapers. Or perhaps, just save this for when migrating out of Docusaurus into Nextjs.

### Docker Deployed on fly.io

- ✅ best option for long-term free-tier docker deployment found at fly.io!

- ✅ set up new dockerfile & fly.toml to

- ✅ London instance deployed with 0.25vCPU 1GB Volume Mount - sufficient for low-concurrency search traffic

  - ✅ benchmark 41.8 concurrent PUT reqs PER SECOND to update synonyms collection, according to stats.json

- ✅

### Dedup & trim #docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback affix in search

The `docsearch.config.json` [Docusaurus V2 template](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/docusaurus-2.json) led to bad search results - duplicated hits & #docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback appearing at the end of every result. [See article for more](/blog/)

- ✅ patch-package to fix #docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback affix to every search link. see [skipToContent bug fix](./#bug-fix-skipToContent)

- ✅ dedup DocScraper search hits due to crawler visiting (\/)?#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback

- ✅ Customize DocSearch box styling & Affix RJKB Logo

- ⚠ DocScraper Synonym list does not get integrated into typesense collections

- ⚠ WSL vmmem will not shut down automatically upon closing Docker containers and Docker Desktop. It requries manual shutdown via cli. If left to run at default settings, it will continue to consume a high amount of RAM ie >7GB despite the actual typesense container never exceeding 500MB usage.

- ⚠ Typesense folder spiked to over 1.5GB in previous builds for unclear reasons - but now recent stable builds result in >50MB

### PUT Synonyms to Typesense Server

- ✅ Output 267 sets of multi-way synonyms (aliases), ie JS === JavaScript === ECMAScript for Search indexing

- ✅ Axios to send PUT request in RJ SSG

- ✅ @deprecated ?alias=\_\_ALIAS to prevent dedup docscraper search hits - unclear how to config docscraper to ignore these query strings but since they don't serve any actual purpose except for debugging - alias redirects have been removed for now

### Noted challenges

- ⚠ MDX links with query strings or URL parameters will show up as duplicates in docscraper search hits

- ⚠ initial scraping attempts used ngrok as fallback were much slower - up to 1 hr to scrape entire database. After fixing DocScraper to directly access internal docker container on same instance, scraping was slightly faster

## 🥇 Unbreaking Docusaurus

[Docusaurus v2.3.1 loads everything into memory by design](./blog/), which can easily run into FATAL ERROR: JavaScript heap out of memory - right at the end of 2hr+ build. [Read more on Docusaurus Scaling limits](./blog/)

Adding `swc-loader` and raising node heap size is mandatory once docusaurus reaches a certain number of pages - otherwise it will crash before emitting the build. However, presently, it STILL crashes during shutdown of IdleFileCachePlugin - but fortunately this occurs after the client & server build has been fully emitted.

### Optimizing Webpack config

- ✅ add swc-loader - 50% lower build time - still terrible at ~2hrs.

  - ❎ `swc-loader` more easy to config than `esbuild-loader`

### Critical Checklist

- Install 32GB RAM Minimum

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('v8').getHeapStatistics().total_available_size / 1024**2)"
```

- ✅ migrate Webpack to swc-loader reduce build time by 50%

- ✅ migrate Webpack minification to custom Terser/SWC plugin

- ✅ set `.env` to increase NODE_OPTIONS `max_old_space_size` to 16GB+

- ✅ `yarn mem` to inspect & log current instance of v8 for specific terminal

- ✅ reduced `DOCUSAURUS_SSR_CONCURRENCY` (a "secret" ENV) to 8 - lowered from default 32 found in `@slorber/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin`

- 🚧 determine how max_old_space_size is being reset to

- ✅ RJ_WEBPACK_PLUGIN - configureWebpack to toggle fast dev mode (skip merge dups/minimize/etc) & to migrate to custom SWC minifier via TerserPlugin

- ✅ docusaurus-plugin-sass

- ✅ @docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock

- ✅ @deprecated `@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image` - worse file size when resized - no SVG support - quality setting too dependent on image source & type

- ✅ @deprecated `plugin-image-zoom` - zoom bug bad UX needs double click - needs high res source else blurry & pointless

- ✅ `docusaurus-theme-search-typesense` -

- ⏳ replace all default Docusaurus Infima CSS with Tailwind

### Lighthouse Optimization

- ✅ serve Fira Code from local server, split into Basic Latin glyphs AND optionally fetch local machine if client has pre-installed

- ✅ serve assets as Brotli AND gzip + raw fallback

- ✅ convert all image assets to webp

- ✅ re-encode videos with better ffmpeg mp4 quality/compression, using custom fine-tuned CLI settings to maximize quality/size

  - 🚧 ✅ encode additional set of mp4/h265 videos for Chrome/Safari

- ✅ convert larger SVG assets into smaller webp size

- ✅ add inline CSS height/width attributes to reduce CLS - including patching @docusaurus components

  - ✅ add missing height/width to SVG & image assets

- ✅ fix lazy loading order for media assets on homepage

- ✅ deprecate buggy `@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image` in favor of custom node.js + sharp script

## 🥇 SEO Optimization

- ✅ home metadata title, desciption, Keywords

- ✅ wiki (docs) metadata title, desciption, Keywords

## 🥇 RegExp Insanity

MDX Loader (^1.6.22) has significant quirks in handling markdown + JSX when inline. Too many silent fails 💩 - /wiki should still contain some. [Docusaurus v2 will remain frozen at v1 mdx-loader](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4029) due to breaking changes in v2.3+.

- ✅ RegExp to escape JSX AND TS Generics for MDX

- ✅ RegExp to escape codeblocks for MDX AND JSX CodeBlock

## 🥇 Fully typed with Typescript

- ✅ decrypt confusing JSON DB types

- ✅ function overloads to expand id_to_mdx with more config & multiple output types

## 🥇 RJKB Branding

### RJKB Homepage

- ✅ Hero Slider with Web Technologies featured on RJKB Site

  - ✅ scroll & hover animation

  - ✅ SVG background

- ✅ Migrate Infima CSS to Tailwind

- ✅ All custom TailwindCSS

- ✅ SVG Feature list

- ✅ dark/light mode variants for all above

- ✅ responsive screen-size & mobile variants for all above

### RJKB SVG Artwork

Custom SVG editing with Inkscape

- ✅ RJKB Site Logo Dark

- ✅ RJKB Site Logo Light

- ✅ RJKB DocSearch Logo

- ✅ Docusaurus Injured At 9K Docs Logo 😜

- ✅ Docusaurus Prof Logo

- ✅ Swizzle custom logo into DocSearch Components

### Blog

- ✅ refactor author to yaml

- ⏳ Randomize Avatar until final one picked

## RJKB Client-side App Demo

- 🔧 Broken after switching to docusaurus - deps/tsconfig change?

## Bug Fix List

### bug-fix-skipToContent

NOTE: all /docs/ routes have been changed to /wiki/

BUG: DocScraper adding multiple search hits due to crawling to /docs/something/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback AND /docs/something#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback

FIX: At site termination regex /$ - this now results in only /docs/something#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback

### Stacktrace error

```bash title="Now the Docusaurus build *only* crashes at 'IdleFileCachePlugin' phase which is at least after the entire Server output has been compiled. However, the Stacktrace shows that the old space limit was reset to something lower, at some point."
