# MOTIVATION

This work is to showcase my self-taught skills as a full-stack engineer.

The journey has been _rough_ but. See [dev log](../blog) for a timeline & design work for this project.

## Key highlights include:

import { SiTypescript } from "react-icons/si"

export const size = "3em"

<SiTypescript size={size} />

import { FaReact } from "react-icons/fa"

<FaReact size={size} />

### Fuzzy Search

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

export const Highlight = ({ children, color }) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: "20px",
      color: "#fff",
      padding: "10px",
      cursor: "pointer",
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </span>
)

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !

# Test

```tsx
export const Hello = () => <div>Hello</div>

<Hello/>
```
